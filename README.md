Have you ever used the Sensitivity button in a [Microsoft 365 App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365)? If so, you've either used the [Azure Information Protection client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection#aip-unified-labeling-client) or [Office's built-in labeling experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps?view=o365-worldwide). In case something doesn't work as expected or you don't see any labeling at all, the 'Unified Labeling Support Tool' will help you.

Before using the 'Unified Labeling Support Tool', please ensure to read its [manual](https://aka.ms/UnifiedLabelingSupportTool) for detailed information about requirements and usage.
