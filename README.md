# Compliance Utility

The 'Compliance Utility' is a powerful tool that helps troubleshoot and diagnose sensitivity labels, policies, settings and more. Whether you need to fix issues or reset configurations, this tool has you covered.

Have you ever used the Sensitivity button in a [Microsoft 365 App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/products-apps-services) or applied a sensitivity label by right-clicking on a file? If so, you've either used the [Office's built-in labeling experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps?view=o365-worldwide) or the [Purview Information Protection labeling client](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018) (previously 'Azure Information Protection unified labeling client'). If something is not working as expected with your DLP policies, sensitivity labels or you don't see any labels at all the 'Compliance Utility' will help you.

The online manual for the 'Compliance Utility' can be found [here](https://aka.ms/ComplianceUtility/manual).
