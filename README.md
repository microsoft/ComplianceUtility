Have you ever used the sensitivity button in a [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/products-apps-services) app or applied a sensitivity label by right-clicking on a file? If so, you've either used the [Office's built-in labeling experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps?view=o365-worldwide) or the [Purview Information Protection labeling client](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018). If something is not working as expected with your DLP policies, sensitivity labels or you don't see any labels at all the Compliance Utility will help you.
