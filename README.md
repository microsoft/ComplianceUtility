# RMS Support Tool

Have you ever dealt with the Sensitivity button in a [Microsoft 365 App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365)? If so, you've either used the [Azure Information Protection client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection#aip-unified-labeling-client) or [Office's built-in labeling solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps?view=o365-worldwide). In case something doesn't work as expected or you don't see any labeling at all, the RMS_Support_Tool will help you.

The 'RMS Support Tool' provides the functionality to reset all Microsoft AIP/MIP/AD RMS client services. Its main purpose is to delete the currently downloaded policies, reset all settings for AIP/MIP/AD RMS services, and it can also be used to collect and analyze troubleshooting data.

Before using the RMS Support Tool, please ensure to read its [manual](https://aka.ms/RMS_Support_Tool) for detailed information about requirements and usage.
