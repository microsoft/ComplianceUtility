# RMS Support Tool

Have you ever used the Sensitivity button in a [Microsoft 365 App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365)? If so, you've either used the [Azure Information Protection client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-information-protection#aip-unified-labeling-client) or [Office's built-in labeling solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps?view=o365-worldwide). In case something doesn't work as expected or you don't see any labeling at all, the RMS_Support_Tool will help you.

The 'RMS Support Tool' provides the functionality to reset all corresponding client services (AIP, MIP, AD RMS). Its main purpose is to delete the currently downloaded sensitivity label policies and thus reset all settings, and it can also be used to collect data for failure analysis and problem solving.

Before using the RMS Support Tool, please ensure to read its [manual](https://aka.ms/RMS_Support_Tool) for detailed information about requirements and usage.
