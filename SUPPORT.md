## Known issues

* **Set-ExecutionPolicy has no effect**

    This applies only to a manual installation: If you downloaded the 'Unified Labeling Support Tool' from its [GitHub website](https://aka.ms/UnifiedLabelingSupportTool/Latest), it will be extended by an [Alternate Data Streams in NTFS](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2013/03/24/alternate-data-streams-in-ntfs) (ADS). If the corresponding website in the ADS is not trusted in your environment, the PowerShell command "Set-ExecutionPolicy" has no effect.

    **Resolution:** Either you right-click the downloaded script files and "Unblock" it, or you add the corresponding website to your trusted site settings.

* **Script does not start and returns an error**

    If you see this message in a PowerShell command window, you are most likely affected by the WindowsÂ® Group Policy setting "Turn on Script Execution":

    ```Text
    Set-ExecutionPolicy : PowerShell updated your local preference successfully, but the setting is overridden by the group policy applied to your system or Set-ExecutionPolicy : Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope.
    ```

    **Resolution:** To resolve this problem, you must remove this Group Policy setting or configure a setting that allows scripts to run. Please request assistance from your administrator to do this. Please also read [Use Group Policy to Manage Execution Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-5.1#use-group-policy-to-manage-execution-policy) and [Set-ExecutionPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-5.1).

* **Installing PowerShellGet module cause an error**

    This applies only to a manual installation: If you follow step 2. Install PowerShellGet-module from the [step-by-step installation](https://aka.ms/UnifiedLabelingSupportTool/#Step-by-step_installation), you may see the following error:

    ```Text
    PackageManagement\Install-Package : No match was found for the specified search criteria and module name 'PowerShellGet'.
    Try Get-PSRepository to see all available registered module repositories.
    At C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PowerShellGet\1.0.0.1\PSModule.psm1:1772 char:21
    + ...          $null = PackageManagement\Install-Package @PSBoundParameters
    +                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (Microsoft.Power....InstallPackage:InstallPackage) [Install-Package],
          Exception
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NoMatchFoundForCriteria,Microsoft.PowerShell.PackageManagement.Cmdlets.
          InstallPackage
    ```

    **Resolution:** To resolve this issue, you must run the following Windows PowerShell command to register the default module repositories:

    ```Text
    PS C:\> Register-PSRepository -Default
    ```

* **"powershell-7.1.4-osx-x64.pkg" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software** 

    This applies only on Apple macOS: If you double-click the file the above message is displayed (the version may differ). It happens due to your Security & Privacy preferences.

    **Resolution:** To work around this issue, either you click "Open Anyway" in the general settings of your Security & Privacy preferences, or you request assistance from your administrator.
