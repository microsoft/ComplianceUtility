## Known issues:

**Set-ExecutionPolicy has no effect**

This applies only to a manual installation: If you downloaded the RMS_Support_Tool from its [GitHub website](https://aka.ms/RMS_Support_Tool/Latest), it will be extended by an [Alternate Data Streams in NTFS](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2013/03/24/alternate-data-streams-in-ntfs) (ADS). If the corresponding website in the ADS is not trusted in your environment, the PowerShell command "Set-ExecutionPolicy" has no effect.

**Resolution:** Either you right-click the downloaded script files and "Unblock" it, or you add the corresponding website to your trusted sites settings.

**Script does not start and returns an error**

If you see this message in a PowerShell command window, you are most likely affected by the WindowsÂ® Group Policy setting "Turn on Script Execution":

"Set-ExecutionPolicy : PowerShell updated your local preference successfully, but the setting is overridden by the group policy applied to your system or Set-ExecutionPolicy : Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope."

**Resolution:** To resolve this problem, you must remove this Group Policy setting or configure a setting that allows scripts to run. Please request assistance from your administrator to do this. Please also read Use Group Policy to Manage Execution Policy and Set-ExecutionPolicy.
